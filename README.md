Deep learning-based solar insolation forecasting using multiple variables.
Data Preparation: Collected data from the Insat-3D satellite, aggregated, and extracted insolation (GHI) values.
Pre-Processing: Pre-processed the dataset by handling missing values and prepared it for deep learning model training.
Model Building: Developed and trained an LSTM model, achieving a prediction error of 5% compared to actual data.
Analysis: Analyed and the model performance and compared various models based on accuracy.
